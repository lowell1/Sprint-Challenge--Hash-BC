* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

add or remove from the front is O(n)
add or remove from the back is O(1)


* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

O(n)

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?

a block is an object that contains its index in the blockchain, a timestamp, a list of transactions, proof, and the hash of the last block

the chain is all of the blocks
 
Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?

the proof of work function searches for a proof or nonce.

then it appends the hash of the last block to the proof. if the resulting number is less than a certain number, then the proof is considered valid, otherwise it tries the next number
